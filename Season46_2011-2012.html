<em>Directed by James Marsh; Starring Philippe Petit, Jean François Heckel, Jean-Louis Blondeau, Annie Allix</em>
<hr>
<p>In 1974 tightrope walker Phillipe Petit and his cohorts masterminded a crime of international renown when they realized Petit's dream of performing a tightrope routine on a line strung between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. This engaging film details the planning and execution of the "artistic crime", recalling a more innocent time and honoring the memory of the Twin Towers as they existed before September 11, 2001. This film won the 2009 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.</p>

<em>Directed by Michael Haneke; Starring Daniel Auteuil, Juliette Binoche, Maurice Bénichou, Annie Girardot</em>
<hr>
<p>Michael Haneke's Cach&eacute; (Hidden) taps into our primordial fear that we are being watched. When bourgeois couple Georges (Daniel Auteuil) and Anne (Juliette Binoche) begin receiving anonymous videotapes of their house and phone calls from strangers asking for Georges, the two begin to question their safety, and their pasts. As the tension builds, Anne comes to believe that Georges is harboring a secret. Directed with Hitchcock-like precision, Haneke presents a mystery with enough camera tricks and tension to keep you thinking about it long after the infamous final shot has faded.</p>

<p>Anglican nuns attempt to establish a convent at the edge a sheer cliff in the Himalayas. Extreme conditions cause them to question their commitment to their task as they confront their demons in an extremely repressive atmosphere. Shangi-La run amok in a brilliant blaze of Technicolor, under the helm of director Michael Powell (<em>The Red Shoes</em>). Black Narcissus Won Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction in 1948.</p>

</div>
<em>Directed by Alfred Hitchcock; Starring Sylvia Sidney, Oskar Homolka, Desmond Tester</em>
<hr>
<p>Based on the Joseph Conrad novel The Secret Agent, this 1936 thriller is not to be confused with Hitchcock's other 1936 film, Secret Agent, or his 1942 film, Saboteur. A man and his wife operate a small cinema in London. Unbeknownst to the wife and her teenaged brother, the husband is part of a gang of foreign saboteurs being hunted by Scotland Yard. Sabotage was produced in England and contains a sequence that Hitchcock later said that he regretted as too distasteful for the audience.</p>

<em>Directed by Josef von Sternberg; Starring Emil Jannings, Marlene Dietrich, Kurt Gerron, Rosa Valetti</em>
<hr>
<p>Concerned by his students' fascination with a sultry night club singer, a professor (Emil Jannings) sets out to investigate, becomes seduced by the fascinating Lola (Marlena Dietrich), and causes his own eventual destruction. Featuring Dietrich's iconic performance of "Falling in Love Again," this is a prime example of German Expressionism at its best.</p>

<em>Directed by Serge Bromberg, Ruxandra Medrea; Starring Romy Schneider, Bérénice Bejo, Serge Reggiani, Jacques Gamblin</em>
<hr>
<p>In 1964 French director Henri-Georges Clouzot (The Wages of Fear, Diabolique) embarked on his most ambitious film to date: <em>L'Enfer</em>. After a frenetic 18 days of shooting he suffered a heart attack, and the production was shut down. More than 40 years later, film archivist Serge Bromberg discovered 185 cans of footage and pre-production tests from <em>L'Enfer</em> and set out to tell the story of Clouzot's unfinished masterwork. Combining interviews with surviving members of the cast and crew with clips of the actual film, Bromberg offers a glimpse into one of cinema's legendary ill-fated productions.</p>

Pei, and his own mother and two half-sisters, the filmmaker tries to reconcile his father's achievements with his profound personal failings.

</div>
<em>Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet; Starring Audrey Tautou, Mathieu Kassovitz, Rufus, Lorella Cravotta, Dominique Pinon</em>
<hr>
<p>An irresistible toast to life, Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Amélie follows the title character (Audrey Tautou) as she literally change the lives of those around her. When Amélie meets and falls in love with a shy adult-store worker, she realizes that, in helping to change other peoples' lives, she is disregarding her own. Propelled by Yann Tiersen's exhilarating musical score, Bruno Delbonnel's vivid cinematography, and Tautou's irresistible charm, Amélie ranks as one of the cinema's finest odes to life and love, and a refreshing homage to the golden age of Hollywood.</p>

<em>Directed by Vittorio De Sica; Starring Lamberto Maggiorani, Enzo Staiola, Lianella Carell, Elena Altieri</em>
<hr>
<p>A definitive work of Italian Neo-Realism, The Bicycle Thief tells the story of Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorana), an unemployed man in post-War Rome who finds a job pasting up posters – work requiring a bicycle. When the bicycle is stolen, Antonio and his young son, Bruno (Enzo Staiola), embark on a desperate search across the city. An indelible portrait of the bond between Antonio and Bruno, <em>The Bicycle Thieves</em> won a special Academy Award as "most outstanding foreign film", seven years before that category existed. In the words of Arthur Miller, "It is as though the soul of man had been filmed."</p>

<em>Directed by Carol Reed; Starring Ralph Richardson, Michèle Morgan, Sonia Dresdel, Bobby Henrey</em>
<hr>
<p>Eight-year-old Phil (Bobby Henrey) idolizes Baines (Ralph Richardson), the butler to his ambassador father. As the unwitting witness to Baines' tea-room tryst with an embassy staffer, Phil becomes the solemn bearer of a secret. But when an idyllic afternoon at the zoo is followed by a nighttime tragedy, and those soft-spoken police arrive to ask all those polite questions, Phil enters a world of lies that unintentionally implicate his idol in murder. Author/screenwriter Graham Greene's personal favorite of his film adaptations (from his story, The Basement Room), <em>The Fallen Idol</em> was Greene's first collaboration with Carol Reed (followed by <em>The Third Man</em>), and ranks with the director's best work.</p>

<em>Directed by Peter Greenaway; Starring Anthony Higgins, Janet Suzman, Anne-Louise Lambert, Hugh Fraser</em>
<hr>
<p>Set in 17th-century England, this erotically charged film features an aristocratic wife (Janet Suzman) who commissions a young draughtsman (Anthony Higgins) to sketch her husband's property. As the draughtsman becomes entangled in the devious scheming in the idyllic estate, details emerge in his drawings that may reveal a murder. A feast of intricate wordplay, extravagant costumes and opulent photography, <em>The Draughtman's Contract</em> weaves a mystery around the maxim "draw what you see, not what you know."</p>
