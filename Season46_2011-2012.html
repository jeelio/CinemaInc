Man on Wire<br />
USA/UK, 2008, Color &amp; B&amp;W, Rated PG-13, 94 Minutes.<br />
Directed by James Marsh. Starring Philippe Petit, Francois Heckel, Jean-Louis Blondeau.
In 1974 tightrope walker Phillipe Petit and his cohorts masterminded a crime of international renown when they realized Petit&rsquo;s dream of performing a tightrope routine on a line strung between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. This engaging film details the planning and execution of the &ldquo;artistic crime,&rdquo; recalling a more innocent time and honoring the memory of the Twin Towers as they existed before September 11, 2001. This film won the 2009 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.</li>

Caché<br />
Austria/Italy/Germany/France, 2005, Color, Rated R, 111 Minutes, Subtitled.<br />
Directed by Michael Haneke. Starring Juliet Binoche, Daniel Auteuil.<br />
Michael Haneke&rsquo;s Cach&eacute; (Hidden) taps into our primordial fear that we are being watched. When bourgeois couple Georges (Daniel Auteuil) and Anne (Juliette Binoche) begin receiving anonymous videotapes of their house and phone calls from strangers asking for Georges, the two begin to question their safety, and their pasts. As the tension builds, Anne comes to believe that Georges is harboring a secret. Directed with Hitchcock-like precision, Haneke presents a mystery with enough camera tricks and tension to keep you thinking about it long after the infamous final shot has faded.</li>

Sabotage<br />
UK/USA, 1936, B&amp;W, Not Rated, 81 Minutes.<br />
Directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Starring Oskar Homolka, John Loder, Sylvia Sidney, Desmond Tester.<br />
Based on the Joseph Conrad novel, The Secret Agent, this 1936 thriller is not to be confused with Hitchcock&rsquo;s other 1936 film, Secret Agent, or his 1942 film, Saboteur. A man and his wife operate a small cinema in London. Unbeknownst to the wife and her teenaged brother, the husband is part of a gang of foreign saboteurs being hunted by Scotland Yard. Sabotage was produced in England and contains a sequence that Hitchcock later said that he regretted as too distasteful for the audience.</li>

The Blue Angel<br />
Germany, 1930, B&amp;W, Not Rated, 113 Minutes, Subtitled.<br />
Directed by Josef von Sternberg. Starring Marlene Dietrich, Emil Jannings.<br />
Concerned by his students&rsquo; fascination with a sultry night club singer, a professor (Emil Jannings) sets out to investigate, becomes seduced by the fascinating Lola (Marlena Dietrich), and causes his own eventual destruction. Featuring Dietrich&rsquo;s iconic performance of &ldquo;Falling in Love Again,&rdquo; this is a prime example of German Expressionism at its best.</li>

Inferno<br />
France, 2009, Color, Not Rated, 94 Minutes, Subtitled.<br />
Directed by Serge Bromberg and Ruxandra Medrea.<br />
In 1964 French director Henri-Georges Clouzot (The Wages of Fear, Diabolique) embarked on his most ambitious film to date: L&rsquo;Enfer (Inferno). After a frenetic 18 days of shooting he suffered a heart attack, and the production was shut down. More than 40 years later, film archivist Serge Bromberg discovered 185 cans of footage and pre-production tests from L&rsquo;Enfer and set out to tell the story of Clouzot&rsquo;s unfinished masterwork. Combining interviews with surviving members of the cast and crew with clips of the actual film, Bromberg offers a glimpse into one of cinema&rsquo;s legendary ill-fated productions.</li>

My Architect: A Son's Journey<br />
USA, 2003, Color, Not Rated, 110 Minutes.<br />

Pei, and his own mother and two half-sisters, the filmmaker tries to reconcile his father's achievements with his profound personal failings. He also travels the globe to view his father's legacy -- the buildings he designed throughout the world.</li>

Amélie<br />
France/Germany, 2001, Color and B&amp;W, Rated R, 121 Minutes, Subtitled.<br />
Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Starring Audrey Tautou, Maurice Benichou, Lorella Cravotta, Mathieu Kassovitz, Serge Merlin, Isabelle Nanty, Dominique Pinon, Rufus.<br />
An irresistible toast to life, Jean-Pierre Jeunet&rsquo;s Amelie follows the title character (Audrey Tautou) as she literally change the lives of those around her. When Amelie meets and falls in love with a shy adult-store worker, she realizes that, in helping to change other peoples&rsquo; lives, she is disregarding her own. Propelled by Yann Tiersen&rsquo;s exhilarating musical score, Bruno Delbonnel&rsquo;s vivid cinematography, and Tautou&rsquo;s irresistible charm, Amelie ranks as one of the cinema&rsquo;s finest odes to life and love, and a refreshing homage to the golden age of Hollywood.</li>

The Bicycle Thief<br />
Italy, 1948, B&amp;W, Not Rated, 90 Minutes.<br />
Directed by Vittorio De Sica. Starring Lamberto Maggiorani, Enzo Staiola.<br />
A definitive work of Italian Neo-Realism, The Bicycle Thief tells the story of Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorana), an unemployed man in post-War Rome who finds a job pasting up posters &ndash; work requiring a bicycle. When the bicycle is stolen, Antonio and his young son, Bruno (Enzo Staiola), embark on a desperate search across the city. An indelible portrait of the bond between Antonio and Bruno, The Bicycle Thief won a special Academy Award as &quot;most outstanding foreign film,&quot; seven years before that category existed. In the words of Arthur Miller, &quot;It is as though the soul of man had been filmed.</li>

The Fallen Idol<br />
UK, 1948, B&amp;W, Not Rated, 92 Minutes.<br />
Directed by Carol Reed. Starring Bobby Henrey, Ralph Richardson.<br />
Eight-year-old Phil (Bobby Henrey) idolizes Baines (Ralph Richardson), the butler to his ambassador father. As the unwitting witness to Baines&rsquo; tea-room tryst with an embassy staffer, Phil becomes the solemn bearer of a secret. But when an idyllic afternoon at the zoo is followed by a nighttime tragedy, and those soft-spoken police arrive to ask all those polite questions, Phil enters a world of lies that unintentionally implicate his idol in murder. Author/screenwriter Graham Greene&rsquo;s personal favorite of his film adaptations (from his story, The Basement Room), The Fallen Idol was Greene&rsquo;s first collaboration with Carol Reed (followed by The Third Man), and ranks with the director&rsquo;s best work.</li>

The Draughtman's Contract<br />
UK, 1982, Color, Rated R, 103 Minutes.<br />
Directed by Peter Greenaway. Starring Anthony Higgins, Janet Suzman.<br />
Set in 17th-century England, this erotically charged film features an aristocratic wife (Janet Suzman) who commissions a young draughtsman (Anthony Higgins) to sketch her husband&rsquo;s property. As the draughtsman becomes entangled in the devious scheming in the idyllic estate, details emerge in his drawings that may reveal a murder. A feast of intricate wordplay, extravagant costumes and opulent photography, The Draughtman&rsquo;s Contract weaves a mystery around the maxim &ldquo;draw what you see, not what you know.&rdquo;</li>
