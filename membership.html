<p>Movies are screened the second Sunday of the month at the Rialto Theatre on Glenwood Avenue in Raleigh's Five Points neighborhood. Admittance is restricted to members. Before each screening, film notes are emailed to members and posted to the website. Film notes for previous screenings from Season 42 to the present may be found on each season's detail page.</p>

<p>Our season runs from September to August, with the upcoming season typically announced in June. The last few seasons have sold out, as we are capped by the Rialto's seating capacity. Season tickets are mailed to members in late August, in time for the first movie of the new season. This ticket is your pass to all twelve movies in the season. You will need to show it upon arrival for admittance to each movie. Please keep it in a safe place and do not lose it!</p>
