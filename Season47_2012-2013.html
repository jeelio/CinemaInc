<em>Directed by Armando Iannucci; Starring Peter Capaldi, Harry Hadden-Paton, Samantha Harrington, Gina McKee</em>
<hr>
<p><em>In the Loop</em> is a mordantly funny satire about the political maneuvering behind the run-up to elective war. Both the U.S. President and U.K. Prime Minister fancy the war. American diplomat Karen Clarke (Mimi Kennedy) and General Miller (James Gandolfini) do not; nor does British Secretary of State for International Development Simon Foster (Tom Hollander). But when Simon accidentally supports military action on TV, he suddenly has a lot of friends across the pond. If Simon can get into the right meeting, if his entourage of one can sleep with the right intern, if either can outwit the Prime Minister's volcanic spin-doctor, Malcolm Tucker (a sublime Peter Capaldi), they may be able to stop the war.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Film Notes (Katherine Reynolds):</em> Here's hoping you like your comedy black! And here's hoping you don't mind dialog that's blue. Very, very blue. With those advisements, hie yourself to the opening of The Cinema, Inc.'s 47th season to see <em>In the Loop</em>, a 2009 British comedy spin-off of the successful BBC series <em>The Thick of It</em>. Full of the kind of English actors with whom we are all besmitten (yes, you are, you know you are) but can probably not name and many equally talented American actors whose faces, if not names, you will recognize — James Gandofini, Mimi Kennedy, David Rasche — this political satire received a 94% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay in 2010.<br />
An unimportant, except to himself, functionary of the British Home Office (Tom Hollander – the Reverend Collins in the latest <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>) pronounces in a BBC interview that war in the Middle East is "unforeseeable." After being soundly berated by the PM's hatchet man, played with zeal by Peter Capaldi (probably first seen in the US in <em>Local Hero</em>), he then steps further into the "poo," as the English would say, by declaring there may be a need in the Middle East to "climb the mountain of conflict."<br />
Saddled with these contradictory, if oblique, statements, he then becomes a pawn between the British Home Office and a visiting American delegation of military and State Department reps. Every character has an agenda, if not two or three. As A. O. Scott says in his <em>New York Times</em> review, "Mr. [Armando] Iannucci maps the queasy interpersonal power games at the heart of any political endeavor. The inhabitants of his universe are in essence well-connected cubicle rats, or junior high school clique members with media access and large standing armies…"<br />
Don't let the idea that they are supposedly all on the same side fool you into believing they have each other's backs. Well, perhaps they do… all the better to stick the knife in. Come, enjoy, and go home thinking "the real world doesn't work like this," you sweet naïve creatures.</p>

Sweden, 2008, 115 min, Color, R, Swedish w/subtitles
</div>
<em>Directed by Tomas Alfredson; Starring Kåre Hedebrant, Lina Leandersson, Per Ragnar, Henrik Dahl</em>
<hr>
<p>Pre-adolescent angst has rarely been as eerie or unsettlingly honest as in this stylish, psychologically complex tale of friendship between a tormented schoolboy (Kåre Hedebrant) and his new neighbor (Lina Leandersson), a reclusive 12-year-old girl who isn't exactly what she seems. Adapted from the popular novel by author John Ajvide Lindqvist, <em>Let the Right One In</em> is the rare genre film that explores sophisticated issues and themes with an intensity that can be hard to achieve within the bounds of realism. The result is a thoughtfully plotted adult fable that builds quiet momentum toward a thrilling climax.</p>

<hr>
<p><em>Film Notes (JA):</em> In 2012, it seems as though we are bombarded with vampire-related subject matter. Feature films as well as television shows. Sparkly ones (<em>Twilight</em>) to angsty ones (<em>Vampire Diaries</em>) to nymphomaniacs (<em>True Blood</em>). <em>Let The Right One In</em> is a "vampire movie," but it does a wonderful job in transcending that. It is directed by Tomas Alfredson (<em>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</em>) and is the original Swedish adaptation of the book with the same title. There was a subsequent American remake titled <em>Let Me In</em>.<br />
A 12-year-old boy, Oskar, meets a strange new neighbor, Eli. It probably won't spoil anything to know that the neighbor turns out to be a vampire. Oskar has a difficult time at school dealing with bullies. Eli, being a vampire, is a bit of a social outcast as well. Not being able to go out in the sun may be a factor. The absence of family support is evident for both characters. Reminiscent of films like <em>Harold and Maude</em>, two offbeat individuals who are isolated by their peers come together and help each other cope with difficult circumstances.<br />
There is a bit of blood and guts in this one, but the execution is very subtle. During one sequence, we see an entire action take place under a distant bridge. The audience is removed from the immediate violence, but it seems a bit more eerie to be watching from a distance. Rather than just show blood squirting everywhere, the level of violence is implied using sound. Much of the violence in the film occurs either out of frame or cleverly placed in the shadows.<br />
<em>Let The Right One In</em> is filled with great performances and beautiful cinematography. The vampire genre, which has been bled dry (although the puns are endless), is not used as a crutch. The interesting aspects of this film have nothing to do with vampires. At first glance, it may seem to exist outside the realm of an individual's presumed tastes, but this is not a film that should be missed by any set of standards.</p>

<em>Directed by Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, Jerry Zucker; Starring Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, Julie Hagerty</em>
<hr>
<p>This spoof of the <em>Airport</em> disaster movies combined sight gags, deadpan dialogue and a cavalcade of clichés to form a broad comedic style that would dominate Hollywood for the next 20 years. Aerophobic former pilot Ted Striker (Robert Hays) boards a passenger jet to woo back his stewardess girlfriend (Julie Hagerty). When food poisoning overtakes the crew, Striker must land the plane, aided by a glue-sniffing air traffic controller (Lloyd Bridges) and Striker's former captain (Robert Stack). The trio of directors would go on to make <em>Top Secret!</em> and <em>Ruthless People</em> before launching successful solo careers.</p>

France, 1958, 117 min, Color, Not Rated, French w/subtitles
</div>
<em>Directed by Jacques Tati; Starring Jean-Pierre Zola, Adrienne Servantie, Lucien Frégis, Betty Schneider</em>
<hr>
<p>Jacques Tati's beloved Monsieur Hulot is a bumbling innocent at sea in the vagaries of the modern world. Like Chaplin and Keaton before him, Tati uses his character's inherent mildness and some wonderfully choreographed slapstick comedy to underscore his commentary on humanity versus the changes of modern life. A film set along the dividing line between Paris' past and its future, <em>Mon Oncle</em> was awarded the Best Foreign-Language Film Oscar in 1958, as well as a Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival.</p>

<hr>
<p>Her family home in danger of being repossessed after her meth-cooking dad skips bail and disappears, Ozark teen Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) breaks the local code of conduct by confronting her kin about their conspiracy of silence. If she fails to track down her father, Ree, her younger siblings, and their disabled mother will soon be homeless. A thriller as bleak as its hardscrabble landscape, <em>Winter's Bone</em> earned Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actress (Lawrence) and Best Supporting Actor (John Hawkes).</p>

<em>Directed by Luis Buñuel; Starring Fernando Rey, Paul Frankeur, Delphine Seyrig, Bulle Ogier</em>
<hr>
<p>Winner of the Oscar for Best Foreign Film, Luis Buñuel's surrealist comedy skewers social conventions through the conceit of a dinner party that cannot be consummated. Interweaving flashbacks and dreams-within-dreams, Buñuel interrogates the absurdities of bourgeois ceremony and hypocrisy as two well-heeled couples and their friends are vexed by such obstructions as botched scheduling, sexual desire, a theater audience, an untimely funeral, and armed revolutionaries. Their inability to eat increasingly suggests a manifestation of their innermost fears, but the film resists such straightforward interpretations.</p>

Germany, 1931, 99 min, B&W, Not Rated, German w/subtitles
</div>
<em>Directed by Fritz Lang; Starring Peter Lorre, Ellen Widmann, Inge Landgut, Otto Wernicke</em>
<hr>
<p>Inspired by the Dusseldorf child murders, Fritz Lang's classic early talkie was a profound influence on Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles (among others) and a touchstone for 1940s American film noir. In 1931 Berlin, police are rounding up the city's criminals in their search for a child murderer. With the heat threatening their livelihood, underworld leaders decide to take matters into their own hands. Though filmed in Weimar Germany, the technically dazzling <em>M</em> solidified Lang's reputation with American audiences and made an international star out of Peter Lorre.</p>

<em>Directed by Wim Wenders; Starring Bruno Ganz, Solveig Dommartin, Otto Sander, Peter Falk</em>
<hr>
<p>In Wim Wenders' lyrical romantic fantasy, Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander) are angels passing unseen through West Berlin, listening to people's thoughts and studying their lives. Though able to make their presence felt in small ways, angels are ultimately observers, unable to interact with people or to experience the joys and suffering of being alive. But when Damiel falls in love with circus acrobat Marion (Solveig Dommartin), he wishes to leave his celestial existence and become human. <em>Wings of Desire</em> features memorable cameos by Peter Falk (as himself) and Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds.</p>

<em>Directed by Barry Levinson; Starring Aidan Quinn, Elizabeth Perkins, Leo Fuchs, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Lou Jacobi, Joan Plowright</em>
<hr>
<p>A moving family saga, <em>Avalon</em> is a fitting capstone to Barry Levinson's Baltimore Trilogy. In 1914 Sam Krichinsky (Armin Mueller-Stahl) emigrates to Baltimore to join his three brothers. Sam's son, Jules (Aidan Quinn), spurns his father's life as a laborer and becomes a salesman, eventually opening Baltimore's first TV store. Mueller-Stahl is a superb embodiment of the immigrant generation, capturing the melancholy of the diaspora of the family from city to suburbs after WWII.</p>
