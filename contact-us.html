<h3><span>Membership</span></h3>
Our season runs from September to August. Movies are screened the second Sunday of the month at the Rialto Theatre on Glenwood Avenue, in Raleigh's Five Points neighborhood. Admittance is restricted to only members. Membership cost is $20 for the season. </p>
<p>Please note that we limit the number of members, as the Rialto holds only so many people. If you are interested in joining, please do not wait! When you submit the application to join, you will be notified via email. Passes are mailed out in late August in time for the first movie of the season.</p>
<p>The Cinema Inc. accepts only checks as payment. We do not accept credit cards or PayPal.</p>
