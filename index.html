<h3>Welcome to <b>The Cinema, </b><span>Inc.</span></h3>
<p>One of the oldest continuing film societies in the nation, The Cinema, Inc. was founded in 1966 by a group of IBM workers using borrowed projection equipment that was installed in the Raleigh Little Theater.  The organization was founded as a nonprofit whose purpose was “the presentation of films of educational, cultural, artistic and historical interest.” After about 15 years the organization moved to the Rialto in the city’s Five Points neighborhood. The group has been screening selections on the second Sunday of every month ever since. Each screening, which averages over 300 attendees, is accompanied by film notes emailed to members.</p>

<em>The Palm Beach Story</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035169/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a><br/>
USA, 1942, 88 min, Color, English, Not Rated
</div>
<em>Directed by Preston Sturges; Starring Claudette Colbert, Joel McCrea, Mary Astor, Rudy Vallee</em><br />
Gerry (Claudette Colbert) and Tom (Joel McCrea) have been married for years and are very much in love, but their marriage is falling apart because of financial problems. Gerry finally decides that it’s best to get a divorce in Palm Beach and start fresh. The film is full of witty dialogue, outstanding one-liners, razor-sharp satire, fantastic characterizations and a great sense of humor. The magic that makes Sturges’ films so entertaining is that they transport the audience to a different place where good things happen to good people and at the end true love always wins.<br />

<p> <em>The Palm Beach Story</em> is one of the maddest of the seven madcap comedies written and directed by Preston Sturges between 1940 and 1947. The storyline is convoluted and crazy.  A married woman, Gerry (Claudette Colbert), leaves her cash-strapped architect husband, Tom (Joel McCrea), and leaves for Palm Beach so she can marry a wealthy suitor and fund her ex-husband’s business ventures. When Tom follows Gerry (get the joke – Tom and "Jerry"?), they encounter a marriage-minded millionaire (Rudy Vallee) and his sister (Mary Astor), who is also on the hunt for a spouse.  Now that all the triangulations are in place, the fun begins.<br/>
Preston Sturges was to this genre what Alfred Hitchcock was to the suspense thriller. While directors such as Howard Hawks and Ernst Lubitsch made these screwball comedies quite successfully, none of them was the <em>auteur</em> that Preston Sturges was.  No writer could match his talent for writing snappy, slang-laden dialog that sounds natural, with characters talking over each other and interrupting each other so often that the dialog seem fresh and effortless.  Sturges' voice is so unique and individual that his style can't be mistaken for anyone else's.<br/>
Besides writing these films, Sturges was deeply involved in casting the films and he also directed the actors himself.   His influence in Hollywood of the 1940s was so great that at one time, Sturges was the third highest paid person in the United States.  The arc of his career was brief but brilliant.<br/>
Sturges' films reflect the culture and tone of America in the 1940s, with characters of various ethnicities as part of the mix, and with the colorful characteristics of their way of expressing themselves preserved. The concept of the American melting pot is intact here, and presented in a manner that makes us laugh with self-acceptance rather than ridicule. Not that there isn't a good deal of malarkey present in the dealings of these characters – far from it.  But <em>The Palm Beach Story </em> demonstrates that the strength of our nation is derived from the richness of our diversity, and was presented at a time when Europe was fracturing along lines of race, nationality and ethnicity.  Not a bad lesson to be learned at any time, especially when the message is delivered with the style and wit of a master in the fullness of his powers.  (KB)</p>

<em>McCabe & Mrs. Miller</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067411/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a><br/>
USA, 1971, 120 min, Color, English, R
</div>
<em>Directed by Robert Altman; Starring Warren Beatty, Julie Christie, Rene Auberjonois, William Devane</em><br />
The film is brilliantly awkward…or, refreshingly authentic if one does not quite accept the glorious image of the American West the early Westerns portrayed. It’s set in a small mining town, a place looking for identity and a leader. The gambling gunslinger, John McCabe (Warren Beatty), believes he can give the town what it needs: a brand new brothel. McCabe runs the brothel as he wants until the classy whore Constance Miller (Julie Christie) arrives and offers him a deal he is forced to consider. Along comes a big mining company wanting to buy him out, but he reluctantly vows to defend his ground.<br />

Soviet Union, 1929, 68 min, B&W, Silent w/intertitles, Not Rated
</div>
<em>Directed by Dziga Vertov; Starring Mikhail Kaufman.</em><br />
This silent film demonstrates the director’s insistence on skyrocketing the medium away from the theatrical and into a specific cinematic style that makes more use of camera technology. There is no distinctive plot or scenario to this film, no titles, actors or sets. What is to be witnessed is "real". Shot in several Russian cities, this hypnotic gem of a film has two goals in mind: to capture the day-to-day activities of the people and to demonstrate a vast array of camera techniques. The film consists of 1,775 separate shots whose average length is 2.3 seconds…a little like watching life on fast-forward. The audience is challenged to put together these events optically and emotionally to go beyond the common playacting of the time.<br />
