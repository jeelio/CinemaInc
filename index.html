<h3>Welcome to <b>The Cinema, </b><span>Inc.</span></h3>
<p>One of the oldest continuing film societies in the nation, The Cinema, Inc. was founded in 1966 by a group of IBM workers using borrowed projection equipment that was installed in the Raleigh Little Theater.  The organization was founded as a nonprofit whose purpose was "the presentation of films of educational, cultural, artistic and historical interest." After about 15 years the organization moved to the Rialto in the city's Five Points neighborhood. The group has been screening selections on the second Sunday of each month ever since. Each screening, which averages over 300 attendees, is accompanied by film notes emailed to members.</p>

<p>Ida is a novice nun preparing take her vows of chastity. She feels entirely ready but her prioress insists she spend some time in the "real world". Ida is instructed to visit her sister, Wanda Gruz. During this visit she learns her birth parents were Jewish, and were killed during World War II. Ida wants to dig deeper. In this Oscar-winning film, Ida is exposed to a variety of secular behaviors which she has been shielded from in the convent. Wanda smokes, drinks, and indulges in casual sex. She's a troubled woman who wears her feelings on her sleeve as consistently as Ida buries hers. The final act details the emotional fallout both characters experience in the wake of their discovery.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Film Notes:</em> <em>Ida</em>, directed by Pawel Pawlikowski, is a film that treats profoundly serious themes such as the search for identity, family relationships, religious vocation, and historical trauma with astonishing gentleness and sensitivity. Ida, the titular character, is a young novice who is about to take her vows. However, before becoming a full-fledged nun, the prioress of Ida's convent informs her that she has a surviving family member, an aunt whom she needs to see to gain some important information about her own background. It turns out that Ida's parents were Jews who perished in the Holocaust and that her aunt was a fighter in the communist resistance who later became a renowned judge called "red Wanda." The two women initially appear as complete opposites. Ida is the pure innocent who is governed by Christian principles of agape and Wanda is the disillusioned worldly woman longing to forget her troubled past through alcohol and sex. However, as the two embark on a quest to discover pieces of their past in this Polish road movie, they grow closer both emotionally and philosophically.<br />
The film is superbly photographed in black and white and the carefully paced editing invites us to contemplate the gradual awakening that Ida experiences. We also experience multiple historical perspectives. Pawlowski, who is himself a child of the post-war generation, shot the film in 2013 after Poland had become a part of the European Union and Westernization had taken place. This sensibility is announced in the use of music in the film especially (perhaps foreboding his most recent academy-nominated film <em>Cold War</em>). The film takes place in 1961 and so we also have a sensitive and multi-layered portrayal of the post-war era in Poland when the country had once again lost its independence. Wanda drives an old Wartburg around the countryside reminiscent of films of the 1960s. Finally, we also have an acknowledgement of Poland's own murderous past during the war and the film's revelatory moment is possibly more thought-provoking than the much touted <em>Sophie's Choice</em>.<br />
Upon the film's initial release David Denby wrote in <em>The New Yorker</em>: "again and again, <em>Ida</em> asks the question, What do you do with the past once you've rediscovered it? Does it enable you, redeem you, kill you, leave you longing for life, longing for escape? The answers are startling." (AM)</p>

Saudi Arabia, 2012, 98 min, Color, PG, Arabic w/subtitles

<em>Directed by Haifaa Al-Mansour; Starring Reem Abdullah, Waad Mohammed, Abdullrahman Al Gohani, Ahd</em>
<hr>
<p>Wadjda is the first feature film from Saudi Arabia and, equally important, directed by a woman. The film tells of Wadjda growing up in Riyadh and learning the dos and don'ts of being a young girl in a male-controlled Muslim culture. Wadjda admires the bicycle that her friend Abdulla rides. She wants one of her own and embarks on a quest to pay for the bike. She signs up for the school's competition on the teachings of the Koran so that she may win the cash prize. The film's multi-generational story plays like a dedication to the spirit of women of the Kingdom.</p>

<em>Sophie's Choice</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084707/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a><br />
USA, 1982, 150 min, Color, R
</div>
<em>Directed by Alan J. Pakula; Starring Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, Peter MacNicol, Rita Karin</em>
<hr>
<p>On his first night at a Brooklyn boarding house, Stingo witnesses a drunken Nathan berating Sophie in a stairwell. He notices a number tattooed on her arm. Nathan hurls insults at Stingo before huffing off, leaving Stingo to comfort Sophie. The next morning Nathan invites Stingo to a picnic as an apology for his behavior. The trio become good friends. The second half of the film switches gears to depict Sophie's time at Auschwitz and her work as a Nazi officer's servant. This backstory brings us full circle as Sophie's past life explodes in the stories of Nathan and Stingo. Few films have handled gut-punching tragedy, romantic melodrama, and intermittent comedy so skillfully.</p>
