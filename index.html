<h3>Welcome to <span>The Cinema, Inc.</span></h3>
<p>One of the oldest continuing film societies in the nation, The Cinema, Inc. was founded in 1966 by a group of IBM workers using borrowed projection equipment that was installed in the Raleigh Little Theater.  The organization was founded as a nonprofit whose purpose was "the presentation of films of educational, cultural, artistic and historical interest." After about 15 years the organization moved to the Rialto in the city's Five Points neighborhood. The group has been screening selections on the second Sunday of each month ever since. Each screening, which averages over 300 attendees, is accompanied by film notes emailed to members.</p>

<em>Sophie's Choice</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084707/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a><br />
USA, 1982, 150 min, Color, R
</div>
<em>Directed by Alan J. Pakula; Starring Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, Peter MacNicol, Rita Karin</em>
<hr>
<p>On his first night at a Brooklyn boarding house, Stingo witnesses a drunken Nathan berating Sophie in a stairwell. He notices a number tattooed on her arm. Nathan hurls insults at Stingo before huffing off, leaving Stingo to comfort Sophie. The next morning Nathan invites Stingo to a picnic as an apology for his behavior. The trio become good friends. The second half of the film switches gears to depict Sophie's time at Auschwitz and her work as a Nazi officer's servant. This backstory brings us full circle as Sophie's past life explodes in the stories of Nathan and Stingo. Few films have handled gut-punching tragedy, romantic melodrama, and intermittent comedy so skillfully.</p>

<p><em>Film Notes (Doug Scott):</em> Academy Awards nominations: Screenplay, musical score by Marvin Hamlisch, cinematography, and costume design. Meryl Streep won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1983, her second.<br />
<em>Sophie’s Choice</em> refers to an extremely difficult decision that a woman, Sophie, has to make; neither outcome is preferable over the other because in her case, both decisions are equally undesirable.<br />
During World War II Sophie arrives at Auschwitz where a camp doctor makes her choose which of her two children would die by gassing and which would continue to live at the camp. Sophie chooses to sacrifice her daughter, Eva, who is seven years old. It is a heart-wrenching decision for Sophie and one that leaves her mourning and overcome with grief. Her son soon disappears and is never heard from again.<br />
After the war, Sophie arrives in Brooklyn, New York, where she meets Nathan (Kevin Kline) and because she has no money, moves in with him. They become lovers. Shortly thereafter, Stingo, played by Peter MacNicol, moves to the same boarding house after he is fired from McGraw Hill, a New York publishing house. He has come to Brooklyn to write the great American novel.<br />
Stingo becomes friends with Sophie and Nathan but is especially attracted to Sophie. They develop a close relationship which infuriates Nathan, who is a paranoid schizophrenic, and who, at times, could be delusional, jealous, violent, and abusive.<br />
Stingo proposes marriage to Sophie. Soon they share a night of sexual abandon. He loses his virginity and Sophie fulfills many of his sexual fantasies. Despite their clear affection for each other, Sophie also has deep feelings for Nathan. She has a choice to make: stay with the struggling author Stingo or return to the schizophrenic Nathan. What choice will Sophie make? Her choice will determine the course of the rest of her life. Who will it be: Nathan or Stingo?</p>

<em>Directed by Marcel Carné; Starring Arletty, Jean-Louis Barrault, Pierre Brasseur, Pierre Renoir</em>
<hr>
<p>Against a backdrop of 19th century Parisian theater life, a great beauty has a lasting effect on the lives of four disparate men: a brilliant mime, who falls debilitatingly in love with her, rendering him unable to accept the love of his own admirer; a womanizing Shakespearean actor, who briefly shacks up with her in a somewhat passionless affair; a rich and powerful count, who saves her from a spurious criminal charge, and subsequently takes her to see the world; and a flamboyant criminal whose mischievous meddling brings to a head all of their various entanglements. The epic sweep of Carné's film is often intoxicating and filled with plenty of enjoyable and engaging moments that are wonderfully entertaining.</p>

</div>
<em>Directed by David Lynch; Starring Naomi Watts, Jeanne Bates, Dan Birnbaum, Laura Harring</em>
<hr>
<p>This film throws away any notion of traditional linear storytelling. It's Hollywood, and a wide-eyed blonde, Betty (Watts), has arrived at her aunt's place to find a mysterious brunette, Rita (Harring), who was in a car accident and lost her memory. Betty endeavors to aid Rita, putting them on a path where dreams and reality collide. Their story interacts with a film director who was strong-armed into hiring an actress for the lead role of his film. However, his connection to the two women may run deeper. This film is sexy, dark, and exotic, with an unpredictable plot twist that forces you to reinterpret what you've seen. What is reality? That's for you to decide.</p>
