<h3>Welcome to <b>The Cinema, </b><span>Inc.</span></h3>
<p>One of the oldest continuing film societies in the nation, The Cinema, Inc. was founded in 1966 by a group of IBM workers using borrowed projection equipment that was installed in the Raleigh Little Theater.  The organization was founded as a nonprofit whose purpose was “the presentation of films of educational, cultural, artistic and historical interest.” After about 15 years the organization moved to the Rialto in the city’s Five Points neighborhood. The group has been screening selections on the second Sunday of each month ever since. Each screening, which averages over 300 attendees, is accompanied by film notes emailed to members.</p>

<em>Nora's Will</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1143148/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a><br />
Mexico, 2008, 92 min, Color, Not Rated, Spanish w/subtitles
<div>
<em>Directed by Mariana Chenillo; Starring Fernando Luján, Enrique Arreola, Ari Brickman, Juan Carlos Colombo</em>
<hr>
<p>Nora is discovered dead on her bed by her ex-husband José. He also discovers a refrigerator full of beautifully prepared dishes - all for the impending Passover seder…the hallmarks of a labor of love. But José sees it as evidence of manipulation. The timing of Nora's death at the beginning of Passover necessitates a delay in burying her. She's put on ice and left in her bedroom until a burial can proceed five days hence. José is an atheist and impatient with the dictates of ceremonial rules. This is a gently-paced movie, sweet-natured with a dry sense of humor and a growing cast of characters including Nora's psychiatrist, her mournful cat, a rabbi, and José's wife and children.</p>

<p><em>Film Notes:</em>  José divorced his wife, Nora, years ago, but lives in an apartment building right across from her. One day, he arrives at Nora's apartment with frozen meat packages that the delivery man sent him because she's not at home. José does not know that Nora lies dead in her bed until he checks the bedroom. Seems she committed suicide by swallowing lots of sleeping pills. The process to bury her is complicated. Nora is Jewish and Nora's body can only be buried on Sunday, two days later, because the day before is the Sabbath and Friday evening is the first night of Passover. Jewish law requires to bury her within 24 hours of her death.<br />
Chaos ensues when José learns that Nora prepared a Passover dinner with everything properly labeled in the refrigerator.  Soon relatives arrive but, without Nora, it's not going to be a typical Seder.<br />
Writer/director Mariana Chenillo blends tragedy, drama and comedy with a light touch. Just when you think the plot will delve more into comedy, it turns around and moves back to tragic elements but without dwelling on them.  Suspense is added when José discovers new information about Nora.<br />
You'll find many interesting characters and surprises in store so that the film manages to be a quietly engrossing, funny and thought-provoking tragicomedy boasting many lively personalities. (RW)</p>

<em>The Adventures of Prince Achmed (Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed)</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015532/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a><br />
Germany, 1926, 81 min, Animated, Not Rated, Silent w/intertitles

<em>Directed by Lotte Reiniger, Carl Koch</em>
<hr>
<p>Prince Achmed accidentally trades his sister to a wicked magician for a flying horse, which takes him to the island of Wak-Wak, where he falls in love with a bird princess named Pari Bann. When demons steal Pari Bann away from Achmed, he turns to Aladdin's magic lantern for help. The film is considered the first animated feature film. This enormously enjoyable fantasy film maintains interest from beginning to end simply from the inventiveness of its ground-breaking animation.</p>

<em>Directed by Orson Welles, Fred Fleck, Robert Wise; Starring Joseph Cotten, Dolores Costello, Anne Baxter, Tim Holt</em>
<hr>
<p>This is an ancient story, yet forever a timely one. It captures the crumbling facade of the turn of the twentieth century as the old lifestyle surrendered to the new. Isabel Amberson (Costello) is courted by Eugene Morgan (Cotton), but he is rebuffed on account of his whimsical happenstance. She marries Wilbur Manifer instead, and their son, George, is terribly over-indulged. Twenty years later, the spoiled and entitled George returns home, his visit coinciding both with his father's death and Eugene's return to court his mother.</p>
