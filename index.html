                <h3>Welcome to <b>The Cinema, </b><span>Inc.</span></h3>
                <p>One of the oldest continuing film societies in the nation, The Cinema, Inc. was founded in 1966 by a group of IBM workers using borrowed projection equipment that was installed in the Raleigh Little Theater.  The organization was founded as a nonprofit whose purpose was, according to its incorporation papers as a registered 503(c), “the presentation of films of educational, cultural, artistic and historical interest.” After about 15 years, the organization, now known as The Cinema, Inc., moved to the Rialto in the city’s Five Points neighborhood. The group has been screening selections from silents to documentaries, foreign-language films to animation, on the second Sunday of every month ever since. Each year, the film selection committee, a subset of the board's directors, makes a list of possibilities. Through a series of votes, the list is shortened to the twelve for the season, divided between foreign-language and English-speaking. Each screening, which averages over 300 attendees, is accompanied by notes on the film emailed to members, and introduced by board member Britt Crews, affectionately known as The Hat Lady for her many colorful hats.</p>

<em>The Palm Beach Story</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035169/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a><br/>
USA, 1942, 88 min, Color, English, Not Rated
</div>
<em>Directed by Preston Sturges; Starring Claudette Colbert, Joel McCrea, Mary Astor, Rudy Vallee</em><br />
Gerry (Claudette Colbert) and Tom (Joel McCrea) have been married for years and are very much in love, but their marriage is falling apart because of financial problems. Gerry finally decides that it’s best to get a divorce in Palm Beach and start fresh. The film is full of witty dialogue, outstanding one-liners, razor-sharp satire, fantastic characterizations and a great sense of humor. The magic that makes Sturges’ films so entertaining is that they transport the audience to a different place where good things happen to good people and at the end true love always wins.<br />

<em>McCabe & Mrs. Miller</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067411/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a><br/>
USA, 1971, 120 min, Color, English, R
</div>
<em>Directed by Robert Altman; Starring Warren Beatty, Julie Christie, Rene Auberjonois, William Devane</em><br />
The film is brilliantly awkward…or, refreshingly authentic if one does not quite accept the glorious image of the American West the early Westerns portrayed. It’s set in a small mining town, a place looking for identity and a leader. The gambling gunslinger, John McCabe (Warren Beatty), believes he can give the town what it needs: a brand new brothel. McCabe runs the brothel as he wants until the classy whore Constance Miller (Julie Christie) arrives and offers him a deal he is forced to consider. Along comes a big mining company wanting to buy him out, but he reluctantly vows to defend his ground.<br />

<em>Man with a Movie Camera (Chelovek s kino-apparatom)</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019760/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a>
<br/>
Soviet Union, 1929, 68 min, B&W, Silent w/intertitles, Not Rated
</div>
<em>Directed by Dziga Vertov; Starring Mikhail Kaufman.</em><br />
This silent film demonstrates the director’s insistence on skyrocketing the medium away from the theatrical and into a specific cinematic style that makes more use of camera technology. There is no distinctive plot or scenario to this film, no titles, actors or sets. What is to be witnessed is "real". Shot in several Russian cities, this hypnotic gem of a film has two goals in mind: to capture the day-to-day activities of the people and to demonstrate a vast array of camera techniques. The film consists of 1,775 separate shots whose average length is 2.3 seconds…a little like watching life on fast-forward. The audience is challenged to put together these events optically and emotionally to go beyond the common playacting of the time.<br />
