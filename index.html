<h3>Welcome to <b>The Cinema, </b><span>Inc.</span></h3>
<p>One of the oldest continuing film societies in the nation, The Cinema, Inc. was founded in 1966 by a group of IBM workers using borrowed projection equipment that was installed in the Raleigh Little Theater.  The organization was founded as a nonprofit whose purpose was “the presentation of films of educational, cultural, artistic and historical interest.” After about 15 years the organization moved to the Rialto in the city’s Five Points neighborhood. The group has been screening selections on the second Sunday of each month ever since. Each screening, which averages over 300 attendees, is accompanied by film notes emailed to members.</p>

<em>The Trouble with Harry</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048750/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a><br />
USA, 1955, 99 min, Color, PG</div>
<em>Directed by Alfred Hitchcock; Starring Edmund Gwenn, John Forsythe, Mildred Natwick, Mildred Dunnock</em>
<hr>
<p>The trouble with Harry is that he is dead, and everyone seems to have a different idea of how he died, what their own culpability is, and what should be done with the body. Harry is buried and exhumed several times by various parties, and let’s just say that it gets complicated. This character piece is a quirky take on "whodunits" and introduces both Shirley MacLaine and Jerry Mathers (aka Beaver Cleaver). Light comedy and dark humor easily coexist in the Technicolor glories of a New England autumn.</p>

<p><em>Film Notes:</em> "Nothing amuses me as much as understatement." - Alfred Hitchcock to Francois Truffaut, <em>Hitchcock/Truffaut.</em><br />
Harry Worp is about to cause a lot of trouble for the residents of a small Vermont town.  The trouble with Harry is that he's dead, and there are way too many people who think that they may be responsible for Harry's demise.<br />
It's a gorgeous fall day in rural Vermont. Three shots ring out over the autumnal hills. A small boy with a toy gun discovers a dead body and runs home to tell his mother. Several townspeople discover the body in turn: an absent-minded physician steps over the body without noticing, a vagrant steals Harry's shoes, and an artist sketches him. The mood is of utter nonchalance in the unexpected presence of a dead body out in the middle of nowhere, and the plot turns not so much on whodunit as it does on what to do with this inconvenient corpse.<br />
<em>The Trouble with Harry</em> is one of Hitchcock's more surreal and subversive films.  The Master of Suspense included very little actual suspense in this film, and when it occurs, it's presented as the suspense of avoiding social embarrassment rather than evading danger. These are nice, likable people who conspire in a cold-blood fashion to get themselves out of a spot of trouble.<br />
Hitchcock had two earlier films that revolved around disposal of a body. In <em>Rope</em>, the murderers have to remove a body secreted in an antique chest. In <em>Rear Window</em>, the murderer has dismembered the victim to remove the corpse from an apartment. These are dark and gruesome situations. Here, the Vermonters use good old-fashioned Yankee ingenuity to address the issue. They work communally, pool their efforts and resources, and try to figure out the best way to rid themselves of the unfortunately deceased Harry.  And they do so on the sunny, autumnal slopes of New England in a landscape devoid of shadows.<br />
<em>The Trouble with Harry</em> is suffused with Americana – the brilliant colors of a New England autumn, the quirky small-town characters, visions of hearth and home – yet at its core, it celebrates Hitchcock's understated British sense of humor. The cast presents Shirley McLaine in her first screen role, includes John Forsythe and introduces Jerry Mathers, two years before they both found fame on television - Forsythe in <em>Bachelor Father</em> and Mathers in <em>Leave It to Beaver</em>.<br />
In <em>Hitchcock/Truffaut</em>, Hitchcock said that "With <em>Harry</em> I took melodrama out of the pitch-black night and brought it out into the sunshine. It's as if I had set up a murder alongside a rustling brook and spilled a drop of blood into the clear water. These contrasts establish a counterpart; they elevate the commonplace in life to a higher level."  Although it was a financial flop in 1955, <em>The Trouble with Harry</em> was one of Hitchcock's personal favorites.  This quirky, surreal black comedy has found new respect and gained an audience.

<em>Nora's Will</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1143148/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a><br />
Mexico, 2008, 92 min, Color, Not Rated, Spanish w/subtitles</div>
<em>Directed by Mariana Chenillo; Starring Fernando Luján, Enrique Arreola, Ari Brickman, Juan Carlos Colombo</em>
<hr>
<p>Nora is discovered dead on her bed by her ex-husband José. He also discovers a refrigerator full of beautifully prepared dishes - all for the impending Passover seder…the hallmarks of a labor of love. But José sees it as evidence of manipulation. The timing of Nora's death at the beginning of Passover necessitates a delay in burying her. She's put on ice and left in her bedroom until a burial can proceed five days hence. José is an atheist and impatient with the dictates of ceremonial rules. This is a gently-paced movie, sweet-natured with a dry sense of humor and a growing cast of characters including Nora's psychiatrist, her mournful cat, a rabbi, and José's wife and children.</p>

<em>The Adventures of Prince Achmed (Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed)</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015532/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a><br />
Germany, 1926, 81 min, Animated, Not Rated, Silent w/intertitles
</div>
<em>Directed by Lotte Reiniger, Carl Koch</em>
<hr>
<p>Prince Achmed accidentally trades his sister to a wicked magician for a flying horse, which takes him to the island of Wak-Wak, where he falls in love with a bird princess named Pari Bann. When demons steal Pari Bann away from Achmed, he turns to Aladdin's magic lantern for help. The film is considered the first animated feature film. This enormously enjoyable fantasy film maintains interest from beginning to end simply from the inventiveness of its ground-breaking animation.</p>
