                        <em>Directed by Kathleen Collins; Starring Billie Allen, Gary Bolling, Clarence Branch Jr., Joe Garcia</em><br />
                        Sara Rogers has reached a crossroads in her life. She’s a professional African-American woman, but the film isn’t defined by race or sex. Sara is a professor at CCNY. She teaches a course on existentialism, but also pursues a project on “ecstasy,” even though confessing that she doesn’t know what it means to be transported outside herself. Sara’s husband, Victor, is her temperamental opposite: ebullient, effusive, outgoing. New horizons appear for Sara when she is asked to star in a student film. Cast in the role of a deceived lover who shoots her partner in a jealous rage, she finds her own emotions transformed.<br />

                    Film Notes: Funny, brilliant and personal, Losing Ground should have ranked high in the canon of indie cinema. But the early times of the 1980s was not an easy time for women or independent filmmakers, and the film was never broadly released.  The director was Kathleen Collins and twenty five years after her death, her daughter, Nina Collins rescued the original negative and created a beautiful new digital master. It is a testament to Kathleen Collins incredible talent and a lasting treasure of African American and women's cinema. Losing Ground tells the story of a marriage of two remarkable people, both at a crossroads of their lives. Sara Rogers, a black professor of philosophy, is embarking on an intellectual quest to understand the “ecstatic” experience just as her painter husband Victor sets off on a more earthly exploration of joy. Celebrating a recent museum painting sale, Victor decides to rent a country house where he can return to working in realism after years of workinG as an abstract expressionist. Away from the city, the couple's summer idyll becomes complicated by Sara's research projects and by Victor's involvement with a young model. One of Sara's students, who is studying film, asks Sara to take a part in a play which casts Sara as the woman scorned in a film version of the song “Frankie and Johnny”.  As she plays the part she experiences a painful emotional awakening and some hard truths about her life. While dealing with strong individuals and feelings, the film is also charming. This work is to be lauded, appreciated and cherished.  (RW)</li>

                        <em>Directed by Preston Sturges; Starring Claudette Colbert, Joel McCrea, Mary Astor, Rudy Vallee</em><br />
                        Gerry (Claudette Colbert) and Tom (Joel McCrea) have been married for years and are very much in love, but their marriage is falling apart because of financial problems. Gerry finally decides that it’s best to get a divorce in Palm Beach and start fresh. The film is full of witty dialogue, outstanding one-liners, razor-sharp satire, fantastic characterizations and a great sense of humor. The magic that makes Sturges’ films so entertaining is that they transport the audience to a different place where good things happen to good people and at the end true love always wins.<br />

                        <em>Directed by Robert Altman; Starring Warren Beatty, Julie Christie, Rene Auberjonois, William Devane</em><br />
                        The film is brilliantly awkward…or, refreshingly authentic if one does not quite accept the glorious image of the American West the early Westerns portrayed. It’s set in a small mining town, a place looking for identity and a leader. The gambling gunslinger, John McCabe (Warren Beatty), believes he can give the town what it needs: a brand new brothel. McCabe runs the brothel as he wants until the classy whore Constance Miller (Julie Christie) arrives and offers him a deal he is forced to consider. Along comes a big mining company wanting to buy him out, but he reluctantly vows to defend his ground.<br />
