<h3>Welcome to <span>The Cinema, Inc.</span></h3>
<p>One of the oldest continuing film societies in the nation, The Cinema, Inc. was founded in 1966 by a group of IBM workers using borrowed projection equipment that was installed in the Raleigh Little Theater. The organization was founded as a nonprofit whose purpose was "the presentation of films of educational, cultural, artistic and historical interest." After about 15 years the organization moved to the Rialto in the city's Five Points neighborhood. The group has been screening selections on the second Sunday of each month ever since. Each screening, which averages over 300 attendees, is accompanied by film notes emailed to members.</p>

<hr><h3>Update! <span>Remainder of the 2019-2020 season cancelled</span></h3>
<p><strong>In the interest of the safety and health of our members and the Rialto theater staff, the board of The Cinema, Inc. has cancelled the remainder of our 2019-2020 series.</strong><br>
The Board has established that members are entitled to a $10 refund. Instructions for claiming the refund have been emailed to current members. Refunds not claimed will be considered a tax-deductible donation to The Cinema, Inc., a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit.<br>
The board will not make a decision on the 2020-2021 season until the future is better defined.  At that time, we will announce our plans and send you a brochure of the series.</p>
