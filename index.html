<h3>Welcome to <b>The Cinema, </b><span>Inc.</span></h3>
<p>One of the oldest continuing film societies in the nation, The Cinema, Inc. was founded in 1966 by a group of IBM workers using borrowed projection equipment that was installed in the Raleigh Little Theater.  The organization was founded as a nonprofit whose purpose was “the presentation of films of educational, cultural, artistic and historical interest.” After about 15 years the organization moved to the Rialto in the city’s Five Points neighborhood. The group has been screening selections on the second Sunday of each month ever since. Each screening, which averages over 300 attendees, is accompanied by film notes emailed to members.</p>

<em>The Ox-Bow Incident</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036244/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a><br />
USA, 1943, 75 min, B&W, Not Rated</div>
<em>Directed by William A. Wellman; Starring Henry Fonda, Dana Andrews, Mary Beth Hughes, Anthony Quinn</em>
<hr>
<p>The story of intolerance and mob mentality is more relevant today than it was in the old west. This is a grim picture, but works to provide a chilling example of subtle evil using powerful dramatics throughout. Gil (Fonda) is a drifter futilely trying to secure normality as he returns to claim a lost loved one. He’s been caught up in a standoff over murder and angry accusations. Men’s lives are on the line as a lynch mob forms. There are exciting tension-packed moments, but the film keeps to a meditative mood, delivering a strong message on the unpredictability of violence and the need to act with logic, not mindless aggression.</p>

<p><em>Film Notes:</em> More than 75 years since its release, William A. Wellman's <em>The Ox-Bow Incident</em> persists as one of the finest "social problem" films of its era or any era.<br />
The setup couldn't be simpler. Two drifters played by Henry Fonda and Art Croft ride into town and enter a saloon where they quickly learn that a local rancher has been murdered by suspected cattle rustlers. A posse forms to hunt down the murderer or murderers and soon finds three men with what are presumed to be stolen cattle. A battle of wills ensues over what should be done with the suspects – should they be lynched on site or taken back to town to stand trial?<br />
<em>The Ox-Bow Incident</em> offers no heroes. Though Fonda is clearly the character we're most meant to identify with, he's ultimately powerless – or unwilling – to do what it takes to see true justice carried out. In truth, Fonda's casting in the role is a stroke of genius. Fresh off his performances as Abe Lincoln and Tom Joad, here he is portrayed as a principled but weak man. It would be his last role before enlisting in the Navy to fight in World War II, and though he would return to heroism as Wyatt Earp in </em>My Darling Clementine</em> (1946) upon his return, Fonda would come to regard <em>The Ox-Bow Incident</em> and his performance among his favorites. The rest of the film's casting is equally strong, most notably the supporting performances by Dana Andrews and Anthony Quinn as two of the suspected murderers.<br />
Wellman, one of the great workhorse directors of the silent and early sound era, was no stranger to films with a social conscience, having directed <em>Wild Boys of the Road</em> and <em>Heroes for Sale</em> for Warner Bros. during the Depression. He was the driving force behind the film's production and proposed the film to 20th Century Fox studio chief Darryl F. Zanuck after reading and loving the book on which it was based. Wellman's direct, no-nonsense approach to the story marries perfectly with the dark subject matter, and at a mere 75 minutes the story moves relentlessly to its grim conclusion.<br />
Seen today, <em>The Ox-Bow Incident</em> remains a searing indictment of mob violence, one that continues to resonate as a cautionary tale and a warning of the dangers of a justice system where "guilty until proven innocent" is the prevailing sentiment. (MVH)</p>

<em>Directed by Eddie Cline, Buster Keaton; Starring Buster Keaton, Eddie Cline, Virginia Fox</em>
<hr>
<p>Hailed as perhaps Buster Keaton's greatest two-reel comedy, <em>Cops</em> sees our intrepid Buster trying to woo the girl of his dreams (of course) by becoming a successful businessman. Chaos ensues when he instead finds himself on the run from an army of policemen after getting into scraps with several local officers. Shot during the Fatty Arbuckle rape-and-murder trial and filled with Keaton's trademark escalation of gags and stunts, <em>Cops</em> is a marvel of construction and one of his most cherished classics.</p>

<em>The Trouble with Harry</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048750/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a><br />
USA, 1955, 99 min, Color, PG</div>
<em>Directed by Alfred Hitchcock; Starring Edmund Gwenn, John Forsythe, Mildred Natwick, Mildred Dunnock</em>
<hr>
<p>The trouble with Harry is that he is dead, and everyone seems to have a different idea of how he died, and what their own culpability is and what should be done with the body. Harry is buried and exhumed several times by various parties, and let’s just say that it gets complicated. This character piece is a quirky take on “whodunits” and introduces both Shirley MacLaine and Jerry Mathers (aka Beaver Cleaver). Light comedy and dark humor easily coexist in the Technicolor glories of a New England autumn.</p>

<em>Nora's Will</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1143148/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a><br />
Mexico, 2008, 92 min, Color, Not Rated, Spanish w/subtitles</div>
<em>Directed by Mariana Chenillo; Starring Fernando Luján, Enrique Arreola, Ari Brickman, Juan Carlos Colombo</em>
<hr>
<p>Nora is discovered dead on her bed by her ex-husband José. He also discovers a refrigerator full of beautifully prepared dishes - all for the impending Passover seder…the hallmarks of a labor of love. But José sees it as evidence of manipulation. The timing of Nora’s death at the beginning of Passover necessitates a delay in burying her. She’s put on ice and left in her bedroom until a burial can proceed five days hence. José is an atheist and impatient with the dictates of ceremonial rules. This is a gently-paced movie, sweet-natured with a dry sense of humor and a growing cast of characters including Nora’s psychiatrist, her mournful cat, a rabbi, and José’s wife and children.</p>
