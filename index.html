<h3>Welcome to <b>The Cinema, </b><span>Inc.</span></h3>
<p>One of the oldest continuing film societies in the nation, The Cinema, Inc. was founded in 1966 by a group of IBM workers using borrowed projection equipment that was installed in the Raleigh Little Theater.  The organization was founded as a nonprofit whose purpose was “the presentation of films of educational, cultural, artistic and historical interest.” After about 15 years the organization moved to the Rialto in the city’s Five Points neighborhood. The group has been screening selections on the second Sunday of each month ever since. Each screening, which averages over 300 attendees, is accompanied by film notes emailed to members.</p>

<em>The Trouble with Harry</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048750/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a><br />
USA, 1955, 99 min, Color, PG</div>
<em>Directed by Alfred Hitchcock; Starring Edmund Gwenn, John Forsythe, Mildred Natwick, Mildred Dunnock</em>
<hr>
<p>The trouble with Harry is that he is dead, and everyone seems to have a different idea of how he died, what their own culpability is, and what should be done with the body. Harry is buried and exhumed several times by various parties, and let’s just say that it gets complicated. This character piece is a quirky take on "whodunits" and introduces both Shirley MacLaine and Jerry Mathers (aka Beaver Cleaver). Light comedy and dark humor easily coexist in the Technicolor glories of a New England autumn.</p>

<em>Nora's Will</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1143148/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a><br />
Mexico, 2008, 92 min, Color, Not Rated, Spanish w/subtitles</div>
<em>Directed by Mariana Chenillo; Starring Fernando Luján, Enrique Arreola, Ari Brickman, Juan Carlos Colombo</em>
<hr>
<p>Nora is discovered dead on her bed by her ex-husband José. He also discovers a refrigerator full of beautifully prepared dishes - all for the impending Passover seder…the hallmarks of a labor of love. But José sees it as evidence of manipulation. The timing of Nora's death at the beginning of Passover necessitates a delay in burying her. She's put on ice and left in her bedroom until a burial can proceed five days hence. José is an atheist and impatient with the dictates of ceremonial rules. This is a gently-paced movie, sweet-natured with a dry sense of humor and a growing cast of characters including Nora's psychiatrist, her mournful cat, a rabbi, and José's wife and children.</p>

<em>The Adventures of Prince Achmed (Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed)</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015532/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a><br />
Germany, 1926, 81 min, Animated, Not Rated, Silent w/intertitles
</div>
<em>Directed by Lotte Reiniger, Carl Koch</em>
<hr>
<p>Prince Achmed accidentally trades his sister to a wicked magician for a flying horse, which takes him to the island of Wak-Wak, where he falls in love with a bird princess named Pari Bann. When demons steal Pari Bann away from Achmed, he turns to Aladdin's magic lantern for help. The film is considered the first animated feature film. This enormously enjoyable fantasy film maintains interest from beginning to end simply from the inventiveness of its ground-breaking animation.</p>
