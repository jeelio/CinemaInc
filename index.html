<h3>Welcome to <span>The Cinema, Inc.</span></h3>
<p>One of the oldest continuing film societies in the nation, The Cinema, Inc. was founded in 1966 by a group of IBM workers using borrowed projection equipment that was installed in the Raleigh Little Theater. The organization was founded as a nonprofit whose purpose was "the presentation of films of educational, cultural, artistic and historical interest." After about 15 years the organization moved to the Rialto in the city's Five Points neighborhood. The group has been screening selections on the second Sunday of each month ever since. Each screening, which averages over 300 attendees, is accompanied by film notes emailed to members.</p>


<!-- <hr><h3>Dear members: <span>We miss you!</span></h3>
<p>But our hopes are high that there's light at the end of the projector in the near future. We look forward to when we can safely come together and again share a movie each secnd Sunday. Until then, we hope you and those you love stay safe and well.</p> -->

<em>Mon Oncle</em>&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050706/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a>
<br>
France/Italy, 1958, 117 min, B&W, Not Rated, French w/subtitles</div>
<em>Directed by Jacques Tati; Starring Jean-Pierre Zola, Adrienne Servantie, Lucien Frégis, Betty Schneider</em>
<hr>
<p>Monsieur Hulot's nephew lives in an ultra-modern technological wonder of a house, far away from Hulot's haphazard apartment building in the old section of town. The boy naturally gravitates to his uncle's way of life, much to the dismay of his businessman father. Chaos ensues. So much of this film is "pure cinema" as it could be watched without subtitles. Tati incorporates many aspects of silent film into his creation, which won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in 1959.</p>

<em>Harold and Maude</em>&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067185/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a>
<br>
USA, 1971, 91 min, Color, Not Rated</div>
<em>Directed by Hal Ashby; Starring Ruth Gordon, Bud Cort, Vivian Pickles, Cyril Cusack</em>
<hr>
<p>It's a standard "Boy Meets Girl," premise, with a twist. Death-obsessed 20-year-old Harold (Bud Cort) meets life-affirming Maude, age 79. Sparks fly and their "alternative love-style" takes off. The cult film to end all cult films, this romantic black comedy is ranked #45 on the American Film Institute's list of 100 funniest movies.</p>

<em>North by Northwest</em>&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053125/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a>
<br>
USA, 1959, 136 min, Color, Not Rated</div>
<em>Directed by Alfred Hitchcock; Starring Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason</em>
<hr>
<p>A case of missing identity sets Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) on a desperate cross-country trip with a mysterious blonde (Eva Marie Saint). He rubs elbows with spies (James Mason and Martin Landau), gets arrested, finds himself under fire at a national landmark, experiences the qualities of train travel versus air travel, and has an interesting lesson in Modernist architecture. Directed by the King of Suspense, this film is entertaining, wryly comedic, and drenched in Technicolor. If you've only seen it on television, you really haven't experienced this film.</p>
