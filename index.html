<h3>Welcome to <span>The Cinema, Inc.</span></h3>
<p>One of the oldest continuing film societies in the nation, The Cinema, Inc. was founded in 1966 by a group of IBM workers using borrowed projection equipment that was installed in the Raleigh Little Theater.  The organization was founded as a nonprofit whose purpose was "the presentation of films of educational, cultural, artistic and historical interest." After about 15 years the organization moved to the Rialto in the city's Five Points neighborhood. The group has been screening selections on the second Sunday of each month ever since. Each screening, which averages over 300 attendees, is accompanied by film notes emailed to members.</p>

Japan, 1959, 94 min, Color, Not Rated, Japanese w/subtitles
</div>
<em>Directed by Yasujirô Ozu; Starring Keiji Sada, Yoshiko Kuga, Chishû Ryû</em>
<hr>
<p>The film concerns a small community of families in Japan, where the neighbors all know each other and are involved in each other's business. One family has two young sons who berate their father for his daily "small talk" about the weather, etc., believing it's phony talk. They want a TV so they can watch sumo wrestling. The father refuses, so the boys take a vow of silence until they get the TV. The director, Okzu, uses the fabric of the community and the neighbors as grist for his story, highlighting the importance of language and communication. The boys' refusal to observe the social niceties sets off a chain reaction in their tiny neighborhood.</p>
<hr>
<p>
<em>Film Notes (Mark Van Hook):</em> The phrase "kids say the darnedest things" has long served as a funny and familiar reference point for parents of young children, one that has spawned multiple versions of a TV show and who-knows-how-many YouTube videos in which kids do, in fact, say the darnedest things. But it hides a deeper truth that's easily missed: "kids say the darnedest things" is funny because kids simply say whatever is on their minds. Adults almost never do.<br />
It's this premise that the great Japanese director Yasujirô Ozu sought to explore in this month's film, <em>Good Morning</em> (original title: Ohayô). Working with frequent screenwriting collaborator Kôgo Noda, Ozu used a disarmingly simple premise (as always) to probe the complexities and peculiarities of how adults in 1950s suburban Japan experienced (for lack of a better phrase) a failure to communicate. In doing so, he created a film that reveals profound insights about the desire for human connection and how, as adults, we build walls – mainly through language – to guard ourselves against it. With fart jokes.<br />
<em>Good Morning</em> is one of Ozu's lightest and most charming pictures, a far cry at first glance from the weightier themes of world-renowned classics <em>Late Spring</em> (1949) and <em>Tokyo Story</em> (1953). But it's no less thoughtful than either of those masterpieces. It centers on two young boys, Minoru and Isamu, who become obsessed with television and demand their parents buy them a set. When the parents refuse, they take a vow of silence, and hilarity ensues.<br />
This all sounds like the stuff of so many TV sitcoms, and perhaps it is, but handled with Ozu's deft touch it becomes something greater. The film's themes around communication and the things we don't say are universal and viewers discovering it for the first time are sure to find something relatable in it.<br />
If not, well, fart jokes are always funny.</p>

UK, 1975, 91 min, Color, PG
</div>
<em>Directed by Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones; Starring Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, Michael Palin</em>
<hr>
<p>With the team assembled, King Arthur and his Round Table embark on a journey to, well, they really have nowhere to go and nothing to do when God suddenly tasks them with locating the Holy Grail. The entire movie is little more than a series of over-the-top misadventures. It's a cornucopia of sheer off-the-wall entertainment, of memorable one-liners, unforgettable characters, zany situations, and uproarious skits. The cast and crew of this film have found the perfect balance between absurdity as part of the plot and absurdity introduced just for the sake of absurdity.</p>

USA, 1934, 91 min, B&W, Not Rated</div>
<em>Directed by W.S. Van Dyke; Starring William Powell, Myrna Loy, Maureen O'Sullivan, Nat Pendleton</em>
<hr>
<p><strong>Nora:</strong> <em>You know, that sounds like an interesting case. Why don't you take it?</em><br />
<strong>Nick:</strong> <em>I haven't the time. I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.</em><br />
The charm of this film is the dialogue between Nick and Nora. Based on Dashiell Hammett's novel, the movie operates from an irresistible premise: sophisticated hard-drinking private eye Nick Charles (Powell) has married wealthy socialite Nora (Loy). Though from two different worlds they get along famously and Nora jumps at the chance to accompany Nick when he is asked to help with an investigation.</p>
