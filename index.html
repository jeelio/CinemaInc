<h3>Welcome to <b>The Cinema, </b><span>Inc.</span></h3>
<p>One of the oldest continuing film societies in the nation, The Cinema, Inc. was founded in 1966 by a group of IBM workers using borrowed projection equipment that was installed in the Raleigh Little Theater.  The organization was founded as a nonprofit whose purpose was “the presentation of films of educational, cultural, artistic and historical interest.” After about 15 years the organization moved to the Rialto in the city’s Five Points neighborhood. The group has been screening selections on the second Sunday of each month ever since. Each screening, which averages over 300 attendees, is accompanied by film notes emailed to members.</p>

<em>The Adventures of Prince Achmed (Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed)</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015532/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a><br />
Germany, 1926, 81 min, Animated, Not Rated, Silent w/intertitles
</div>
<em>Directed by Lotte Reiniger, Carl Koch</em>
<hr>
<p>Prince Achmed accidentally trades his sister to a wicked magician for a flying horse, which takes him to the island of Wak-Wak, where he falls in love with a bird princess named Pari Bann. When demons steal Pari Bann away from Achmed, he turns to Aladdin's magic lantern for help. The film is considered the first animated feature film. This enormously enjoyable fantasy film maintains interest from beginning to end simply from the inventiveness of its ground-breaking animation. (This film is being shown with short <em>The Mysterious Geographic Explorations of Jasper Morello</em>.)</p>

<em>The Magnificent Ambersons</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035015/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a></br>
USA, 1942, 88 min, B&W, Not Rated

<em>Directed by Orson Welles, Fred Fleck, Robert Wise; Starring Joseph Cotten, Dolores Costello, Anne Baxter, Tim Holt</em>
<hr>
<p>This is an ancient story, yet forever a timely one. It captures the crumbling facade of the turn of the twentieth century as the old lifestyle surrendered to the new. Isabel Amberson (Costello) is courted by Eugene Morgan (Cotton), but he is rebuffed on account of his whimsical happenstance. She marries Wilbur Manifer instead, and their son, George, is terribly over-indulged. Twenty years later, the spoiled and entitled George returns home, his visit coinciding both with his father's death and Eugene's return to court his mother.</p>

<em>The Bigamist</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045557/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a></br>
USA, 1953, 80 min, B&W, Not Rated
</div>
<em>Directed by Ida Lupino; Starring  Joan Fontaine, Ida Lupino, Edmund Gwenn</em>
<hr>
<p><em>The Bigamist</em> has noir overtones. The noir element is of entrapment through moral weakness. O'Brien is a lonely traveling salesman in LA when he meets Lupino, a young waitress on a Hollywood bus tour. A relationship develops and one thing leads to another, but not before O'Brian tries to extricate himself. He has a wife in Frisco. O'Brien, who is morally weak, digs himself deeper into a bind that cannot be broken without tragic consequences. The script is soft on the bigamist, although he is punished. However, there is maturity and sensitivity in a scenario where decent people get themselves into a mess simply because of normal human frailties. The strength of the film is in the lead performances and the screenplay which sensitively deals with extra-marital sex and single motherhood.</p>
