<h3>Welcome to <b>The Cinema, </b><span>Inc.</span></h3>
<p>One of the oldest continuing film societies in the nation, The Cinema, Inc. was founded in 1966 by a group of IBM workers using borrowed projection equipment that was installed in the Raleigh Little Theater.  The organization was founded as a nonprofit whose purpose was “the presentation of films of educational, cultural, artistic and historical interest.” After about 15 years the organization moved to the Rialto in the city’s Five Points neighborhood. The group has been screening selections on the second Sunday of each month ever since. Each screening, which averages over 300 attendees, is accompanied by film notes emailed to members.</p>

<em>The Magnificent Ambersons</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035015/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a></br>
USA, 1942, 88 min, B&W, Not Rated

<em>Directed by Orson Welles, Fred Fleck, Robert Wise; Starring Joseph Cotten, Dolores Costello, Anne Baxter, Tim Holt</em>
<hr>
<p>This is an ancient story, yet forever a timely one. It captures the crumbling facade of the turn of the twentieth century as the old lifestyle surrendered to the new. Isabel Amberson (Costello) is courted by Eugene Morgan (Cotton), but he is rebuffed on account of his whimsical happenstance. She marries Wilbur Manifer instead, and their son, George, is terribly over-indulged. Twenty years later, the spoiled and entitled George returns home, his visit coinciding both with his father's death and Eugene's return to court his mother.</p>

<hr>
<p><em>Film Notes: </em>The movie starts in a time over a century ago, yet the characters are people we could recognize today. We all know a George Minifer, someone who is so self-centered that we long to see karma deliver a come-uppance. Perhaps we recognize Eugene, spurned by his first love and, when both are single again decades later, trying to rekindle a romance. Or Lucy, a young woman who could probably have her pick of suitors but whose heart is drawn to someone who doesn't deserve her beauty and charm.</br>
Although we can watch the same film stock over and over again, we never see the same movie. New experiences, even the movie itself, make us see it with new eyes every time. As a kid, I was entranced by the clothes and balls. As an adult, I look at Agnes Moorehead's Aunt Fanny, approaching her twilight years with no job skills and no savings, and think of my own mother's concern – no, fear and anxiety are more accurate – that she would outlive her nest egg. How many of us set money aside in a 401k, 403b, or IRA, and pray that a market downturn doesn't wipe it away just when we need it? Or maybe that already happened, and we must work a few more years because we cannot afford not to.</br>
I've always had a special fondness for Ms. Moorehead. She was part of Orson Welles' Mercury Theater company, and had appeared in <em>Citizen Kane</em>, released the previous year. But, as a kid in the 70s, my first exposure to her was as the over-the-top Endora in television's <em>Bewitched</em>, which my siblings and I enjoyed after school in syndication. In high school, we watched <em>Twilight Zone</em> reruns late at night, and we saw her tour-de-force in the "Invaders" episode, where she does not speak. And we heard her in the radio drama "Sorry, Wrong Number", where only her voice conveys character and emotion.</br>
This film also marked something of an introduction for me to the magic of movie-making. The television show may have been a special on Orson Welles (I don't quite recall) and one segment was about the scene in <em>The Magnificent Ambersons</em> where Joseph Cotten's Eugene picks up several characters whose sleigh has overturned and gives them a ride back to town in his car. Something wasn't right with the dailies – the early automobile is supposed to be bouncing on cobblestone streets, but the characters' voices sounded too even. The "making of" clip showed one actress sitting on a plank supported by two sawhorses, dubbing her lines while the film crew bounced the ends of the planks. It was years before I got to see the whole movie, on television thanks to a Netflix DVD. I can't wait to experience it as it was intended – on a big screen with a theater full of people. (JE)</p>

<em>The Adventures of Prince Achmed (Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed)</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015532/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a><br />
Germany, 1926, 81 min, Animated, Not Rated, Silent w/intertitles
</div>
<em>Directed by Lotte Reiniger, Carl Koch</em>
<hr>
<p>Prince Achmed accidentally trades his sister to a wicked magician for a flying horse, which takes him to the island of Wak-Wak, where he falls in love with a bird princess named Pari Bann. When demons steal Pari Bann away from Achmed, he turns to Aladdin's magic lantern for help. The film is considered the first animated feature film. This enormously enjoyable fantasy film maintains interest from beginning to end simply from the inventiveness of its ground-breaking animation. (This film is being shown with short <em>The Mysterious Geographic Explorations of Jasper Morello</em>.)</p>
<!-- <hr>
<p><em>Film Notes:</em> Lotte (Charlotte) Reiniger (2 June 1899 - 19 June 1981) made animated films in her home by a technique called silhouette animation.  She is credited with having made the first full-length animated film in 1926.  Walt Disney's first feature-length film, <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</em>, didn't appear until 1934.  Walt Disney used cels overlaid on a stationary background and drew cel after cel to achieve motion.  Lotte Reiniger also used a stationary background but moved complex cutout cardboard and metal figures frame after frame to create motion.  Joints in her figures were sewn together with thread to allow the joints to move.  Her husband, Carl Koch, did the photography.  Her stationary background was a back-lighted glass plate with immovable scenery.<br>
Lotte Reiniger was quite daring in making this film because no one had considered making a full-length animated film with a story line.  Until then, animated shorts were comedy intended to entertain in short attention spans.  She is a true pioneer in the history of animation.<br>
The story line of Prince Achmed comes from "One Thousand and One Nights", also known as "The Arabian Nights".  There is a wicked sorcerer who tricks Prince Achmed into riding a magical flying horse, with which he flies into various adventures.  He falls in love with Princess Pari Banu and must prove his love with a series of battles to win her heart. (PBC)</p> -->

<em>Directed by Anthony Lucas; Starring Joel Edgerton, Helmut Bakaitis, Tommy Dysart, Jude Beaumont</em>
<hr>
<p>Set in a world of iron dirigibles and steam-powered computers, this Gothic horror-mystery tells the story of Jasper Morello, a disgraced aerial navigator who flees his Plague-ridden home on a desperate voyage to redeem himself.  The chance discovery of an abandoned dirigible leads Jasper through uncharted waters to an island on which lives a terrifying creature that may be the cure for the Plague.  The journey back to civilization is filled with horrors but in a shocking climax, Jasper discovers that the greatest greatest horror of all lies within man himself.  (Mark Shirrefs, IMDb.com)</p>
<!-- <hr>
<p><em>Film Notes:</em> The film is based on Lotte Reiniger's silhouette animation method but greatly enhanced with modern computer-generated software effects.  The images are incredibly complex and the story line is a form of science fiction called steampunk.  Victorian England period dirigibles drift through air and computers are steam-driven.  Influences from this genre include writers like Edgar Allen Poe, Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, etc.<br>
The short was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 2006.  It has won many awards in short film festivals worldwide. (PBC)</p> -->

<em>The Bigamist</em>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045557/" target="_blank"><img src="images/imdb.png" alt="IMDB" title="View on IMDB"></a></br>
USA, 1953, 80 min, B&W, Not Rated
</div>
<em>Directed by Ida Lupino; Starring  Joan Fontaine, Ida Lupino, Edmund Gwenn</em>
<hr>
<p><em>The Bigamist</em> has noir overtones. The noir element is of entrapment through moral weakness. O'Brien is a lonely traveling salesman in LA when he meets Lupino, a young waitress on a Hollywood bus tour. A relationship develops and one thing leads to another, but not before O'Brian tries to extricate himself. He has a wife in Frisco. O'Brien, who is morally weak, digs himself deeper into a bind that cannot be broken without tragic consequences. The script is soft on the bigamist, although he is punished. However, there is maturity and sensitivity in a scenario where decent people get themselves into a mess simply because of normal human frailties. The strength of the film is in the lead performances and the screenplay which sensitively deals with extra-marital sex and single motherhood.</p>
