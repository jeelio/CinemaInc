Soviet Union, 1925, 66 min, B&W, Not Rated, Silent w/intertitles
</div>
<em>Directed by Sergei M. Eisenstein; Starring Aleksandr Antonov, Vladimir Barskiy, Grigoriy Aleksandrov, Ivan Bobrov</em>
<hr>
<p>In 1905 the crew of the Russian battleship <em>Potemkin</em> were fed up with their maggot-ridden meat rations and decided it was time to rise up against their officers. After overtaking their ship and pulling into Odessa, word of their rebellion spread and ignited a revolutionary spirit. Soon the Czar sent his troops to quell the uprising and many protesters and innocents alike were slaughtered. This exhilarating film was shot in black and white with stunning use of montage. The scenes of the uprising are rousing and incredible. The Odessa staircase scene, where a baby carriage with baby in tow glides slowly down the stairs, is one of the most famous.</p>

<em>Directed by Duncan Jones; Starring Sam Rockwell, Kevin Spacey, Dominique McElligott</em>
<hr>
<p>Sam Rockwell stars as Sam Bell, working a three-year shift by himself on the moon and supervising a new kind of energy mining to boost the depleted reserves of resources on Earth. His only companion is a robot called GERTY (voiced by Spacey) who manages the base and looks after Sam's every need. Sam's shift is nearly over and recently he has been going stir crazy. Distracted, he crashes his moon rover and wakes up later in sick bay. He has orders not to go outside, but does so anyway. He finds GERTY exhibiting strange behavior and the environment is not quite what it appears to be. The film is tantalizing as it draws us in and then pushes us away.</p>

Japan, 1985, 114 min, Color, Not Rated, Japanese w/subtitles
</div>
<em>Directed by Jûzô Itami; Starring Ken Watanabe, Tsutomu Yamazaki, Nobuko Miyamoto</em>
<hr>
<p>Few movies did more to introduce Westerners to contemporary Japan and its sense of humor than this culinary comedy. It is a series of meditations on food - many short sketch-like pieces lasting but a few minutes. For example, an etiquette teacher teaches her students how to eat Italian pasta, which they want to slurp in the Japanese manner. A gangster has kinky sex with his girlfriend using crazy food items as aphrodisiacs. The main vignette is the story of pixieish Tampopo, a middle-aged single mother and owner of a failing ramen shop. A truck driver, Goro, and his buddy Gun offer to help Tampopo perfect her recipe and turn the shop into a thriving business.</p>

</div>
<em>Directed by Yasujirô Ozu; Starring Keiji Sada, Yoshiko Kuga, Chishû Ryû</em>
<hr>
<p>The film concerns a small community of families in Japan, where the neighbors all know each other and are involved in each other's business. One family has two young sons who berate their father for his daily "small talk" about the weather, etc., believing it's phony talk. They want a TV so they can watch sumo wrestling. The father refuses, so the boys take a vow of silence until they get the TV. The director, Okzu, uses the fabric of the community and the neighbors as grist for his story, highlighting the importance of language and communication. The boys' refusal to observe the social niceties sets off a chain reaction in their tiny neighborhood.</p>

<hr>
<p>With the team assembled, King Arthur and his Round Table embark on a journey to, well, they really have nowhere to go and nothing to do when God suddenly tasks them with locating the Holy Grail. The entire movie is little more than a series of over-the-top misadventures. It's a cornucopia of sheer off-the-wall entertainment, of memorable one-liners, unforgettable characters, zany situations, and uproarious skits. The cast and crew of this film have found the perfect balance between absurdity as part of the plot and absurdity introduced just for the sake of absurdity.</p>

USA, 1934, 91 min, B&W, Not Rated</div>
<em>Directed by W.S. Van Dyke; Starring William Powell, Myrna Loy, Maureen O'Sullivan, Nat Pendleton</em>
<hr>
<p><strong>Nora:</strong> <em>You know, that sounds like an interesting case. Why don't you take it?</em><br />
<strong>Nick:</strong> <em>I haven't the time. I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.</em><br />
The charm of this film is the dialogue between Nick and Nora. Based on Dashiell Hammett's novel, the movie operates from an irresistible premise: sophisticated hard-drinking private eye Nick Charles (Powell) has married wealthy socialite Nora (Loy). Though from two different worlds they get along famously and Nora jumps at the chance to accompany Nick when he is asked to help with an investigation.</p>

France, 1967, 115 min, Color, Not Rated, French w/subtitles</div>
<em>Directed by Jacques Tati; Starring Jacques Tati, Barbara Dennek, Rita Maiden</em>
<hr>
<p>Tati spent years and tons of money building "Tativille", a huge glass-and-steel movie set comprising a modern-day airport, office building, and restaurant. It was as inhuman as possible, clashing in every way with human nature. Tati filled his set with a group of gaggling American tourists, the loping Hulot (Jacques Tati), and a host of other bizarre characters. The film has a chaotic feel; unpredictable like life. Nearly every joke has to do with the clash between man and modern living, and there are plenty. In the restaurant scene, things really get crazy when a wild party continues until dawn. The miraculous ending leaves you smiling about the way we humans have of demolishing order wherever we go.</p>

<em>Directed by Julie Dash; Starring Cora Lee Day, Alva Rogers, Barbarao</em>
<hr>
<p>This is the first feature-length film helmed by an African-American woman. It is an impeccably rich view of Gullah Islanders, a culture that few "outsiders" have ever known. Saint Helena island is off the coast of South Carolina where slaves, divorced from mainland influences, formed their own culture, and passed it down to their descendants once slavery was abolished. Over time the men and women of the community decide whether to leave the island or stay. Their stories are told through the West African-derived language as well as through a vocabulary of physical gestures.</p>

</div>
<em>Directed by Stanley Donen; Starring Audrey Hepburn, Albert Finney, Eleanor Bron</em>
<hr>
<p>This film is one of the most insightful films about the institution of marriage. It doesn't shy away from complex emotions, both in joy and sorrow. The film takes place over five distinct time periods, each chronologically depicting a trip through the French countryside at different times in a couple's lives. The story lines cleverly interweave as cars and hair styles from different periods cut between past and future selves. The strength of the film is that it avoids easy answers and gives the characters room to talk out their problems. They don't reach solutions, but find compromise. Isn't that what relationships boil down to?</p>

<em>Directed by Bernardo Bertolucci; Starring John Lone, Joan Chen, Peter O'Toole</em>
<hr>
<p>The winner of nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture, this is a stunning example of a historical movie of outstanding quality. Director Bertolucci has created an intensely personal movie, humanizing a culture with a depiction of a man at its center. From the age of 3 in 1908, when he is crowned emperor of China, Pu Yi lives through the vastly changing world of twentieth-century China. Political events in his teen years force him to live in the Forbidden City where he has the same pampered life with no real power. The film follows Pu Yi, his supporters, his betrayers, his lovers, and his own growing conscience as his personal story reveals the story of China.</p>

Taiwan, 1991, 237 min*, Color, Not Rated, Mandarin/Shanghainese w/subtitles<br />
<em>* Please note this film has a running time of just under four hours. </em>
</div>
<em>Directed by Edward Yang; Starring Chen Chang, Lisa Yang, Kuo-Chu Chang</em>
<hr>
<p>Set over the course of most of a year in 1961, the film deals with a subculture of mainland Chinese who fled to Taiwan after the victory of the Chinese Communists in 1949. Their children are now living in a state of uncertainty and have taken to forming street gangs for a sense of safety and control. There are many subplots, but the main thrust of the story has to do with a gangster's school-age girlfriend. He has gone into hiding, but has been warned never to let a girl become the cause of bad blood. The arc of the movie conveys dislocation, people adrift between patriotism, Taiwanese traditions or something more elusive. The children seem to understand all this, but can't comprehend how to crawl out from under it.</p>

</div>
<em>Directed by Hayao Miyazaki; Starring Yôji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Yûko Tanaka</em>
<hr>
<p>Inflicted with a deadly curse, a young warrior, Ashitaka, sets out in search of a cure. He becomes entangled in a battle that matches a clan of humans against animal gods. Among them is Princess Mononoke, who was raised by wolves. This haunting, beautifully-animated, acclaimed fantasy epic is a sophisticated story of clashing cultures in an era of environmental recession and industrial expansion. Miyazaki takes a hard look at humanity's desire to consume and its history of destroying to create, and asks if there isn't a balance worth striking between the natural and the technological.</p>
