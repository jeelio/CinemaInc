<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044706/" target="_blank"><em>High Noon</em></a> - Members' Choice!<br />
USA, 1952, 85 min, B&W, English, PG<br />
<em>Directed by Fred Zinnemann; Starring Gary Cooper, Grace Kelly, Thomas Mitchell</em><br />
This is the <em>Citizen Kane</em> of Western cinema. It is, simply put, a masterpiece. The acting, the music, the set, the dialogue, the camera work are all perfection. The film is a clear display of how the strong swallowed the weak in small, dirty, western towns where people would panic at the sight of armed bandits. This is the story of a man who would not run away - a man who left his beautiful bride alone - so he can confront four dangerous criminals who had a bone to pick with him. We follow Marshal Will Kane as he searches for men willing to help him fight for his life. It's all very unpredictable.</li>

Netherlands/France/West Germany, 1988, 107 min, Color, , Not Rated<br />
<em>Directed by George Sluizer; Starring Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu, Gene Bervoets, Johanna ter Steege, Gwen Eckhaus</em><br />
When Saskia and Rex, a young Dutch couple, stop at a gas station in France, Saskia goes to the store to buy some drinks. She never returns; she seemingly just disappears. For three years, Rex pursues an extensive search for her. In an unusual deviation early in the film, the likely perpetrator is revealed and time is devoted to examining the stranger's eerily normal family life. At the conclusion of this extraordinary, gripping film, Rex will reach the bottom of the mystery. What he finds will stay with you for a long time.</li>

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078754/" target="_blank"><em>All That Jazz</em></a><br />
USA, 1979, 123 min, Color, English, R<br />
<em>Directed by Bob Fosse; Starring Roy Scheider, Jessica Lange, Leland Palmer, Ann Reinking</em><br />
His name is Joe Gideon and he is a movie director and Broadway choreographer. He is successful, wealthy, admired, and feared. He is also an unapologetic cheater who is addicted to amphetamines. He is struggling with a creative block, hates his own work and it's eating him alive. He finally creates a bold new concept for an upcoming show. Shortly after, he collapses and is told that he will die unless he changes his lifestyle. This is a brutally honest movie showing how spectacular and utterly ridiculous life on Broadway can be. Joe's story is essentially Bob Fosse's life story told via a series of magnificently choreographed pieces that rightfully place the movie among the greatest musicals ever filmed.</li>

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048021/" target="_blank"><em>Rififi</em></a><br />
France, 1955, 118 min, B&W, French w/subtitles, Not Rated<br />
<em>Directed by Jules Dassin; Starring Jean Servais, Carl Möhner, Robert Manuel, Janine Darcey</em><br />Most modern films see the execution of the heist itself as the climax. However, in this film the theft serves as a gateway into the study of both masculinity and the unwritten codes that bind men together. A team of four skilled thieves assemble to pull off a crime that is seemingly impossible and risk everything on a plan that requires utmost precision. The characters are always acutely aware of every detail of their surroundings. This methodical approach allows the tension to build until the actual heist which is presented without dialogue. While the men might be skilled thieves, the film suggests that they are ultimately boys playing a dangerous game that is above their heads.</li>

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097108/" target="_blank"><em>The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover</em></a><br />
Netherlands/UK/France, 1989, 124 min, Color, English, NC-17<br />
<em>Directed by Peter Greenaway; Starring Richard Bohringer, Michael Gambon, Helen Mirren, Alan Howard</em><br />
On one level you can describe this movie simply in terms of the characters and the lustful and unspeakable things they do to one another. On another level it is a wildly exuberant, bitingly satirical examination of excess, bad taste, and the most basic strengths and weaknesses of the human body. Dark humor and irony pepper nearly every scene. Most of the film takes place inside a fine French restaurant where the chef cares deeply for both the artistry and taste of the food. The restaurant's owner visits nightly to spout absurd discourses on every subject. The acting is superb in this gorgeous, visually rich film that tells the story of a fascinating hedonistic world.</li>

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037382/" target="_blank"><em>To Have and Have Not</em></a><br />USA, 1944, 100 min, B&W, English, Not Rated<br />
<em>Directed by Howard Hawks; Starring Humphrey Bogart, Walter Brennan, Lauren Bacall</em><br />
An American running a fishing charter in the Caribbean romances a young lounge singer and reluctantly becomes involved with the French Resistance by agreeing to secretly transport a de Gaulle lieutenant. Based on Hemingway's novel, the story is sleepy and resembles <em>Casablanca</em>. However, the film is largely of note due to the debut of Lauren Bacall and the beginning of her relationship with Bogart. The two sizzle on the screen. Even though we're trained to look at the romance as the central relationship in a movie, it's Harry's (Bogart) caretaking of his first mate Eddie (Brennan) that serves as the film's real message. It's the sticking by the Eddies of the world, even though they cause nothing but trouble, that define a man's character and suggest he does the right thing.</li>

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0016884/" target="_blank"><em>Flesh and the Devil</em></a><br />
USA, 1926, 112 min, B&W, Silent w/intertitles, Not Rated<br />
<em>Directed by Clarence Brown; Starring John Gilbert, Greta Garbo, Lars Hanson</em><br />This is the movie that made Greta Garbo a legend. She glows on the screen and never looked more beautiful. The story is a love triangle between two best friends and a wanton woman. Set in Austria before the first World War, Leo and Ulrich are soldiers and best friends from childhood. Ulrich's sister, Hertha, is in love with Leo. Felicitas (Garbo) plays a completely wicked woman. She seduces Leo but neglects to tell him she's married. Her husband catches them and demands satisfaction in a duel. Leo kills him and is advised to leave the country. When Leo returns years later, he learns that his best friend has married Felicitas. This woman has no shame. You can probably guess where the story goes from here so no more will be said.</li>

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426578/" target="_blank"><em>Sophie Scholl: The Final Days (Sophie Scholl: Die letzten Tage)</em></a><br />
Germany, 2005, 120 min, , German w/subtitles, Not Rated<br />
<em>Directed by Marc Rothemund; Starring Julia Jentsch, Alexander Held, Fabian Hinrichs, Johanna Gastdorf</em><br />
On February 10, 1943, Sophia Scholl and her brother Hans, students at Munich University and part of an underground resistance movement, were arrested for distributing anti-Nazi propaganda on campus. This film uses transcripts and testimonials to recreate those events centered on Sophie's interrogation. A large chunk of the film is devoted to Sophie's questioning by an austere Nazi official over several hours. Filmed like a tennis match it rhythmically builds to crescendos and then calms down creating suspense and intrigue. This movie puts human faces on the casualties of war and reminds us of mistakes we must never make again.</li>

Spain, 2006, 121 min, , Spanish w/subtitles, R<br />
<em>Directed by Pedro Almodóvar; Starring Penélope Cruz, Carmen Maura, Lola Dueñas, Blanca Portillo</em><br />
This is a ghost story that includes lust, incest, rape, and murder. The opening scene is set at a cemetery where Raimunda (Cruz) and her sister Sola (Dueñas) are cleaning the gravestone of their parents who died in a fire. Or did they? For starters, the sisters have an aunt who claims their mom, Irene, has returned from the dead to take care of her. Sola passes off Irene as a Russian and puts her to work in an illegal beauty salon. When Raimunda's teen daughter Paula claims to have stabbed Raimunda's husband when he tried to rape her, Raimunda hides the body in a freezer. Now add a new twist: a neighbor who's dying of cancer. Got that? No matter. Plot is merely Almodovar's way into the souls of his women.</li>

USA, 2003, 89 min, Color, English, R<br />
<em>Directed by Tom McCarthy; Starring Peter Dinklage, Paul Benjamin, Jase Blankfort, Paula Garcés</em><br />
Directed by Tom McCarthy, starring Peter Dinklage, Patricia Clarkson, Bobby Cannavale<br />
When Finn (Peter Dinklage) inherits an old abandoned train station from the man who was his only friend, he moves there to live a life of solitude, inasmuch as his whole life he's had to deal with dwarfism and being treated as an outcast. Only he doesn't find solitude there, instead he meets a chatty hotdog vendor and a troubled woman. An unlikely friendship develops as the three simply deal with life and the complications life brings. What makes this movie genius is that it's so natural and realistic. Peter Dinklage is the glue that holds the pieces of the story together. His subtle expressions set the tone of the movie, moving us to laugh or feel sad.</li>

Soviet Union, 1975, 107 min, B&W, Russian w/subtitles, G<br />
<em>Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky; Starring Margarita Terekhova, Oleg Yankovskiy, Filipp Yankovskiy, Ignat Daniltsev</em><br />
Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, starring Margarita Terekhova, Filipp Yankovskiy, Ignat Daniltsev<br />
<em>Mirror</em> is indeed a film that can provide immense satisfaction to a patient, intelligent viewer interested in good cinema, art, classical Western music and Russian literature. This film is a very complex autobiographical film of Tarkovsky (director) reflecting on his memories, good and bad, from childhood to adult life. <em>Mirror</em> does not have a plot, it does not contain any violence or sex, and it does not follow chronologically. Tarkovsy elevated the film to a sublime state of reflection (hence the title) on the importance of family and spiritual life, encouraging the viewer to notice similar visual and aural elements that one might have experienced in one's own life.</li>

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051036/" target="_blank"><em>Sweet Smell of Success</em></a><br />
USA, 1957, 96 min, B&W, English, Not Rated<br />
<em>Directed by Alexander Mackendrick; Starring Burt Lancaster, Tony Curtis, Susan Harrison, Martin Milner</em><br />
This film is about scratching (the "you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours" type), and two men without morals. One is a powerful newspaper columnist, who could create stars in minutes, and destroy them just as fast. The other man is a ambitious and manipulative press agent who both admires and fears the columnist. The plot is practically irrelevant. It is the unique dialogue, the one-liners and colorful expressions that fascinate, as well as the atmosphere of chic clubs, bars and influence of powerful politicians, corrupt cops and beautiful women. The movie is a master class in demagoguery and machinations.</li>
